# Known Issues

## PR-A environment

- The local machine has Python 3.12.3 but no Python 3.11 executable, so the declared 3.11 lower
  bound was checked through syntax/tool configuration rather than a second interpreter run.
- The `opencode` command is not installed locally. PR-A therefore makes no real OpenCode claim;
  real plugin/MCP evaluation remains a PR-D acceptance gate.
- PR-A has fake model evidence only. Live local/host/frontier routing remains a PR-G gate.
- `timeout_seconds` is validated configuration but the synchronous fake adapter does not simulate
  wall-clock timeout enforcement; live adapters must implement that contract in PR-G.
